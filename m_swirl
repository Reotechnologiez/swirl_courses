 -  Output: Recall that the Estimates are the coeffients of the independent variables of the linear model (all of which are percentages) and they reflect an estimated change in the dependent variable (fertility) when the corresponding independent variable changes. So, for every 1% increase in percent of males involved in agriculture as an occupation we expect a .17 decrease in fertility, holding all the other variables constant; for every 1% increase in Catholicism, we expect a .10 increase in fertility, holding all other variables constant.  		 +  Output: Recall that the Estimates are the coefficients of the independent variables of the linear model (all of which are percentages) and they reflect an estimated change in the dependent variable (fertility) when the corresponding independent variable changes.
